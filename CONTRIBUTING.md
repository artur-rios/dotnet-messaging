# Contributing

## Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK 10.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) or later
- Git

Use the official [.NET CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/) to build, test and publish the project.
If you want, optional helper toolsets I built to facilitate these tasks are available:

- [Dotnet Tools](https://github.com/artur-rios/dotnet-tools)
- [Python Dotnet Tools](https://github.com/artur-rios/python-dotnet-tools)

## Build

```bash
dotnet build src/ArturRios.Messaging.sln
```

## Testing

The test suite is xUnit, and every test is named with the Given / When / Then pattern. Every test class
carries a `Category` trait, so the two kinds can be run — and reported — separately:

```bash
dotnet test src/ArturRios.Messaging.sln --filter "Category=Unit"
dotnet test src/ArturRios.Messaging.sln --filter "Category=Functional"
```

Unit tests exercise the code in isolation against test doubles.
Functional tests send through a real HTTP server on the loopback interface and inspect the request that arrives.
CI runs the two as separate jobs, and both must pass before a pull request can be merged.

The unit job also fails when a test has no `Category` trait, since no job would run it, and when
`dotnet format --verify-no-changes` finds a file to reformat; run `dotnet format src/ArturRios.Messaging.sln` before pushing.

## Branching and pull requests

`develop` is the integration branch and the base for all new work; `main` only holds released code.

Branch off `develop` — `feature/<name>` for features, `fix/<name>` for fixes (`feat/`, `bugfix/`, `chore/`,
`refactor/`, `docs/`, `ci/`, `test/`, `perf/` and `build/` are accepted too) — and open a pull request back into
`develop`.

Dependabot's `dependabot/*` dependency-update branches are accepted into `develop` too.

Pull requests into `develop` and `main` must pass the tests and the branch policy check.

Commit messages follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) with a lowercase subject, e.g.
`feat: make mailgun api version configurable` or `fix: stop writing the Mailgun key onto a shared client`.

Record every change a package consumer would notice under `## [Unreleased]` in [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md), in the
same pull request that makes it.

## Versioning

The project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). As a library, its contract is the
public API and the documented behavior of the `ArturRios.Messaging` package:

- **Major**: a change that can break a consumer — a public type or member removed, renamed or given a different
  signature, or documented behavior changed in a way callers may rely on. Its CHANGELOG entry carries an
  `### Upgrading from <X>.x to <Y>.0` subsection telling consumers what to change.
- **Minor**: new public API, or a behavior change existing callers do not have to adapt to, dependency updates
  included.
- **Patch**: a fix or tweak that leaves the public API and the documented behavior as they are.

The version number lives in one place, `<Version>` in `src/ArturRios.Messaging.csproj`. It is set on the release branch
(see [Releasing](#releasing)), the package is packed with it, and the branch policy check and the publish workflow
reject a release branch or tag whose version differs from it.

## Releasing

1. Cut `release/<version>` from `develop`, set `<Version>` in `src/ArturRios.Messaging.csproj` to that version, rename
   `## [Unreleased]` in [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) to `## [<version>] - <yyyy-mm-dd>` above a fresh, empty
   `## [Unreleased]`, update the compare links at the bottom, and open a pull request into `main`. Only `release/*`
   branches can be merged into `main`.
2. Once it is merged, tag the merge commit on `main` with the version. Pushing the tag publishes the package to
   nuget.org and GitHub Packages:

   ```bash
   git switch main && git pull
   git tag <version> && git push origin <version>
   ```

   Tag with the bare version, e.g. `1.3.0`. Some older releases were tagged with a `v` prefix
   (`v1.1.0`); those tags stay as they are, but new tags drop the prefix.

3. Open a pull request from `main` into `develop` to bring the release back into the integration branch.

Only the repository owner can push version tags, and the publish workflow rejects tags that do not point at a commit on
`main` or whose version differs from the one in the csproj.
